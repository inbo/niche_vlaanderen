Running niche
##############

Whenever you want to use niche_vlaanderen (either from the command line or Python) you need
to start from the `Anaconda/Miniconda prompt` (in the start menu)
and activate the environment (in this example, an environment you called `niche` during the installation):

.. code-block:: shell

    (C:\Users\myusername\Miniconda3) C:\Users\myusername> conda activate niche

Optionally - Jupyter Notebook
=============================

If you want to run niche_vlaanderen interactively, we recommend using a  `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_.

To use Jupyter Notebooks, from the `Anaconda/Miniconda prompt` do:

.. code-block:: default

    (C:\Users\myusername\Miniconda3) C:\Users\myusername> conda activate niche
    (niche) C:\Users\myusername> jupyter notebook

This should open a webbrowser pointing towards http://localhost:8888 . If your browser does not open, try looking for the correct URL at the `Anaconda prompt`.

The :doc:`tutorials` will use these jupyter notebooks, and are the best place to continue from here.
